* Arbor Tutorial for NestConf

This tutorial take you from the bare bones concepts of bio-physically detailled
cells to a simple network in Arbor. It is meant mainly for self-directed study
and experimentation with the opportunity to ask questions. If you are tackling
this on your own (i.e. not during a workshop), please contact us on Gitter.

* Getting Started
You'll need recent versions of Linux or MacOS, Python3, and possibly a C++ compiler.
Start by cloning this repository and then open a shell:

#+begin_src bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install arbor numpy seaborn matplotlib networkx jupyter
jupyter lab
#+end_src

While your packages are being install, you can take a look at the introduction
in ~intro.pdf~. Then, open the ~arbor-tutorial.ipynb~ notebook.
